# Counter-arguments

(1) Argument #1: "Dude just because a creature CAN do something, doesn't mean they're going to, particularly the Eagles, who had their own mind about things."

Counter-argument: That's fine. But why were envoys not sent to the Great Eagles? The Fellowship and their allies could have at least tried.

(2) Argument #2: [ChristopherJRTokien] on /r/lotr: "Why do you think the fact that they are the messengers of Manwe means thry should or could do what you've suggested?"

Counter-argument: 

>>$>> Why do you think the fact that they are the messengers 
>>$>> of Manwe means thry should or could do what 
>>$>> you've suggested?

The proposal is to send out envoys to find out what they CAN actually do. Does that make sense?

(1) Discussion #1: on /r/LOTR on Jan. 24, 2019:

AboutCode:=> My Great Eagles argument still seems to be going along, btw. That's the point of this entire project. I have had at least one person agree that the Great Eagles could have been utilized for the crossing of the Ford at Rivendell.

wjbc :=> [wjbc then brings to our attention the following:]

-> The Eagles are a dangerous 'machine'. I have used them sparingly, and that is the absolute limit of their credibility or usefulness. --- J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 210.

AboutCode:=> 
>>$>> J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 210.

Everybody quotes this letter. My response to this is the following: "One word. Envoys." For further details, see Argument #1.

07CE says:=> he Eagles would drawn the gaze of Sauron himself had they brought the Fellowship to Mordor and it's very likely they would be killed very quickly.

AboutCode:=>
Your arguments have been already dealt with.

I will respond to just the counter-arguments in the first paragraph.

>>$>> The Eagles would drawn the gaze of Sauron himself 
>>$>> had they brought the Fellowship to Mordor and it's very 
>>$>> likely they would be killed very quickly. 

I am not arguing that the Eagles should have been used to bring the Ring to Mordor. Or the Fellowship to Mordor. That's not the argument at all. The argument rests on the optimization of a two dimensional matrix.
