# Counter-arguments

(1) Argument #1: "Dude just because a creature CAN do something, doesn't mean they're going to, particularly the Eagles, who had their own mind about things."

Counter-argument: That's fine. But why were envoys not sent to the Great Eagles? The Fellowship and their allies could have at least tried.
